# Face-Emotion-Recognition
building a solution for detecting face emotion from image input using computer vision

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing human emotions from facial images. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract relevant features from facial images and classify them into different emotion categories.

# Problem Statement
Facial emotion recognition is a challenging task due to variations in facial expressions, lighting conditions, and individual differences. The goal of this project is to create a robust model that can accurately identify emotions across diverse datasets and real-world scenarios.


# Data Acquisition:
using publicly available datasets like FER-2013 or CK+.

# Data Preprocessing:
Resize images to a consistent size(28*28) and to insure it is gray scale.
Normalize pixel values to a specific range (0-1).
Perform data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to increase data diversity.

# Model Architecture:
Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification:
Four conv2D layers each followed by BatchNormalization,MaxPooling and Dropout to overcome overfitting
then we have Three fully connected layers also followed by BatchNormalization and Dropout and in the end there is the classification layer
Adjust the final layers of the model to suit the specific task of emotion classification(dense layer with 7 nodes and softmax activation).

# Training:
Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the model using an appropriate loss function (categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (Adam with initial lr=0.0001). Â  
Monitor training progress using metrics like accuracy and loss.

# Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set to assess its generalization ability.
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
